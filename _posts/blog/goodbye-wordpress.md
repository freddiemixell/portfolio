Well, I think it's safe to say WordPress is becoming more and more useless every day. Thank you to the developers who have worked so hard to maintain it, seriously. It's time to move forward into the world of micro-services. This CMS that I'm using is 100% customizable, open source and serverless.

The best part is you can replace custom post types, taxonomies, fields and more with this CMS. All without having a server. This is actually better for the environment because cloud computing uses less electricity.
